    "# ED Classification in DuckDB\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how we can classify ED encounters into one of 9 potential categories: \n",
    "- **Non-Emergent**: The patient’s initial complaint, vitals signs, medical history, and age indicated that immediate medical care was not\n",
    "required within 12 hours.\n",
    "- **Emergent, Primary Care Treatable**: Treatment was required within 12 hours, but care could have been provided in a primary care\n",
    "setting.\n",
    "- **Emergent, ED Care Needed, Preventable/Avoidable**: Emergency care was required based on the complaint or procedures or resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable or avoidable if timely and effective primary care had been provided.\n",
    "- **Emergent, ED Care Needed, Not Preventable/Avoidable Injury**: Emergency care was required and primary care treatment could not have prevented the condition.\n",
    "- **Injury**\n",
    "- **Mental Health Related**\n",
    "- **Alcohol Related**\n",
    "- **Drug Related (excluding alcohol)**\n",
    "- **Not in a Special Category, and Not Classified**\n",
    "\n",
    "We start from a list of 402 ED encounters, and apply ED classification logic to assign one of the 9 categories above to each encounter. ED encounters are bucketed into one of those 9 categories solely based on their primary diagnosis. This notebook reads in a csv file (`ed_encounters.csv`) that has one row per ED encounter and applies ED classification logic to assign one of 9 categories to each encounter."
